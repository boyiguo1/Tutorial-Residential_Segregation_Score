# Theory
## Overview
 According to @massey1988dimensions, there are five major dimensions of segregation
 
 - _Evenness_: spatial distribution of different groups among _units_ in a metropolitan area
 - _Exposure_: possibility of interaction between minority and majority group members
 - Concentration: relative amount of physical space occupied by a minority group in the metropolitan area
 - Centralization: how a group spatially located near the center of an urban area
 - Clustering: which areal _units_ inhabited by minority members adjoin one another, or cluster, in space
 
Total of 19 indexes. By default, the majority refers to non-Hispanic Whites.

## Focus

- Dissimilarity index for Evenness: the percentage of population would have change residence to have the same percentage overall
  - 0.0 (complete integration) to 1.0 (complete segregation)
- Interaction index for Exposure: probability that a minority person shares a unit area with a majority person
  - 0.0 (complete segregation) to 1.0 (complete integration)
- Isolation index for Exposure: probability that a minority person shares a unit area with a minority person
  - 0.0 (complete integration) to 1.0 (Complete segregation)
  
## Remarks
  - Define the geographic units: in our calculation, we aggregated tract level statistics to reflect county level information
  - When there are only two groups, interaction index and isolation index sum up to 1
  - "Indexes of evenness and exposure are correlated but measure different things: exposure measures depend on the relative sizes of the two groups being compared, while evenness measures do not."
  - Isolation index only require one group, a minority group
