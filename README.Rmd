# Calculating Residential Segregation Scores

## Remarks

1. When no majority, don't know how to calculate dissimilarity, and interaction score should be default to 0, and isolation score should be 1 if there is no other minority. In our case, we default them to 0.

The goal of Tutorial-Residential_Segregation_Score is to ...

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub.
