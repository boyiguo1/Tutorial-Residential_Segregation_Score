# Calculating Residential Segregation Scores

The purpose of this repository is to provide a reproducible pipeline, implemented in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), to investigate residential segregation using US census data. This repository provides convenience to social scientists who have needs to access residential segregation indices for their research. While the current repository primarily focuses on three scores [TODO(boyiguo1): ], we hope to inspire others to adapt the pipeline and expand this calculation for their own research needs.

## Get Started

1. Download [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and (RStudio IDE)[https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/]
1. Install the necessary workflow packages [`targets`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/targets/index.html) and [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) if you don't already have
2. Open the R project in an R console and call `renv::restore()` to install the required R packages. Please give permission to install the necessary packages. This will mirror the version of packages used in the creation of the manuscript exactly.
3. Acquire your census api key string via [https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html), and replace in the `_targets.R` file
4. Modify the code to reflect your research needs. The places that requires individualization is marked with the tag `TODO:`. You can use [global search](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200710523-Navigating-Code) to attain a list of modifications within (RStudio IDE)[https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/].
5. call the `targets::tar_make()` function to run the pipeline.

## Example
[TODO: Add Alabama Map]

## Remarks

1. When no majority, don't know how to calculate dissimilarity, and interaction score should be default to 0, and isolation score should be 1 if there is no other minority. In our case, we default them to 0.
