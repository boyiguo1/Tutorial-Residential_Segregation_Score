# Calculating Residential Segregation Indices

The purpose of this repository is to provide a simple and reproducible [R](https://www.r-project.org/) pipeline to investigate residential segregation (RS) using US census data. The pipeline contains two components:

1) pulling decennial US census data of Year 2000, 2010, 2020 via R package [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/index.html)
2) calculating three residential segregation indices, including dissimilarity, isolation and interaction indices, at the preferred geographical level, e.g. county or census tract level
    
We hope this work would relieve social scientists from repetitive data pulling, and inspire to adapt the reproducible pipeline.

> Note: If you don't have the time to go through the whole documentation, please finish reading the [Remarks](#remarks) Section before modifying the code

## Get Started

1. Download [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
1. Install the necessary workflow packages [`targets`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/targets/index.html) and [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) if you don't already have
2. Open the R project in RStudio and call `renv::restore()` to install the required R packages. Please give permission to install the necessary packages. This will mirror the version of packages used in the creation of the work exactly.
3. Acquire your census api key string via [https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html), and replace at the beginning of the `_targets.R` file
4. Modify the code to reflect your research needs. We highlight the places that requires customization with the tag `TODO:`, which can be enlisted via a [global search](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200710523-Navigating-Code), i.e. `cmd/control + shift + f`.
    * Change year, states, and geographic levels, where the upper level is your preferred level and the lower level is the level constituent the upper level. For example, in order to calculate county level indices (upper level), we need to have census tract level statistics (lower level).
    * __Confirm if the variable codes in census databases match with your preferred variables.__ The variable code is year-specific, i.e. could be different depending on the year you use. For example, the same variable code `P003003` means `Total!!Population of one race!!White alone` in [2000 data](https://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/sf1/variables.html), and means `Total!!Black or African American alone` [2010 data](https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1/variables.html)
5. call `targets::tar_make()` in the console to run the pipeline.

## Examples
In this section, we provide two examples for calculating RS indices of _one state_ (stored in [`master` branch](https://github.com/boyiguo1/Tutorial-Residential_Segregation_Score/tree/master)) or _multiple states_ (stored in [`meds_desert` branch](https://github.com/boyiguo1/Tutorial-Residential_Segregation_Score/tree/meds_desert)) respectively.

### One State Example: _2010 Alabama Dissimilarity Index at County Level_
In this example, we provide the pipeline to calculate the indices for a single state. As an bonus, a section of code that plots a index to the map are supplied, as shown in _Figure 1_\*. _Figure 1_ includes two maps of the 2010 Alabama County Level dissimilarity index, White (majority) with respect to  Black (minority), calculated using different definitions of lower level geographic unit, i.e. census tract level and block level. 

>\*: The example pipelie only produces one of the plots, where caption had been manually modified.

> Note: For those who are interested in 2020 AL Indices, please refer to [test case](https://github.com/boyiguo1/Tutorial-Residential_Segregation_Score/issues/7#issuecomment-1005776330) in [Issue 7](https://github.com/boyiguo1/Tutorial-Residential_Segregation_Score/issues/7) as an example of configuration

### Multiple States Example: _2010 RS Indices of Medication Desert at Census Tract Level_
The example demonstrate how to calculate residential segregation for multiple states collectively, either via an intput file or via an inline code. Please find the pipeline via [`meds_desert`](https://github.com/boyiguo1/Tutorial-Residential_Segregation_Score/tree/meds_desert) branch.


## Remarks
In this section, we discuss our observations when creating the indices, which includes thoughts on numeric calculation with census data, interpretation, and practice of data sharing.

### Numeric Calculation

1. During the calculation, we observe that depending on how the areal units are defined, it is possible to have areas with no majority or minority population at all, i.e. $n_{\text{majority}} = 0$ or $n_{\text{minority}} = 0$. This complicates the calculation of the scores, for example, introducing infinite or `NaN` as a score. Without finding any remedies in the literature yet, we defined these indices as missing values collectively. 

2. It is very important to __confirm if your variable codes match with your anticipated variable with the census data base__. Even though we build error prevention mechanism in the code to numerically verifies, we are not certain it will catch the error 100\% particularly with the flexibility that allow users' customization. We provided how code changes in different years, see [Get started](#get-started).

3. In the calculation, we do not assume that the minority numerically complements the majority, i.e the numbers of minority and majority sums to the total. These indices would be different from the indices calculated with the complementing assumption.

4. Scores are calculated as defined. Revser coding to have the same direction would require manual work.


### Interpretation

1. What it is designed for originally. How it would be interpreted when using nationally

2. When calculating the indices at a geogrphic level, it is possible to define the lower level that constutes the upper level differently, as we have seen in the Alabama example. How much it changes.

1. what would be the rs score interpreted when few self-defined majority and minority located. e.g. When calculating the indices of White (majority) compared to Black (minority) in a Indian conservatory, neither is majority and minority in that sense. How to defined.

1. The implementation of the three scores in this pipeline is neither an endorsement nor disapprovement of the indices. It simply serves the purpose of calculation convienience. Without much expertise in measurement thoerem, we advise users to use the indices with cautious, and be critical when interpreting the results.

3. Based on Massey and Dunton, the use of RS measurements should be not be limited to 1 index, instead with several.

>"Our survey of the research literature leads us to conclude that segregation should be measured not with one index, but with several."


### Practice

1. Sending requests, FIPS, leading zero, Excel automatically omitting leading zeros. enclose the FIPS with quoationa marks

2. For ease of collaborators, it is better to generate the geoid when pulling data, instead of giving individual FIPS for different levels. It is not a big  deal, but potentially create human error when concatenating the FIPS. for example leading zero problem

3. Carefully choose which level of fips you want to have. potentially leading to selection bias, where severity is unknown.


4.  Meanwhile, when we categorize people, we only considered the people who reported one race, while it seems possible to report more than 1 race, e.g. P003008, Total!!Two or More Races in [2010 census data](https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1/variables.html)
